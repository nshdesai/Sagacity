  h2 Why Sagacity?
  p.lead Sagacity was developed to counter a daily issue that students face — note taking. Rather than valuing the quality of their notes, students are forced to write rudimentary and fragmented notes in order to keep up with the fast pace of our modern day education. Often, there are times where it is difficult to read one’s own handwriting. There may be mistakes, poor formatting, and more errors. Sagacity fixes those problems by correcting these errors using A.I, enhancing the quality and accuracy of one’s notes.
